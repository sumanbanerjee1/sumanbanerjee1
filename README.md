## About Me
I am currently an M.S. scholar under the supervision of [Dr. Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering (C.S.E), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) I joined the department in July, 2016. My research area broadly spans Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Specifically, I am working on Goal-oriented, End-to-End Dialog Systems. I am also associated with a project of [Accenture Labs](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/accenture-technology-labs-index) on a closed-domain dialog system.
